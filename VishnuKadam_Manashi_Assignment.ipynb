    "#### Why general Purpose LLMs are insufficient ?\n",
    "General purpose LLMs are trained with specific benchmarks in mind. AI labs focus on popular advertisable metrics related to question answersing, coding, maths, etc. The task of mental health and related qa's is not a major priority. This is evident through the technical reports of popular open models like deepseekV2 [1] and kimi-k2 [2].When these general purpose models are used their training forces them to focus more on answering questions and keeping user engaged in a question answer loop instead of prioritizing the mental health of the user. This leads to vague or misleading answers being generated by the models, which can be harmful when interacting with vulnerable individuals. There are various documented instances of this happening[3]. \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss\n",
    "To reduce the chances of the model ignoring critical clinical mental health facts, we use the following loss formulation during training\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume there are $N$ clinical categories indexed by $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\}$, each assigned an importance rank $i$ ($i = 1$ is least important, $i = N $ is most important). Let $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be a hyperparameter controlling the strength of prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unnormalized weight for category $i$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_i = i^{p}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The normalized weights are\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde{w}_i = \\frac{i^{p}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} j^{p}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\ell_i$ denotes the loss associated with category $i$, the final clinical risk–weighted loss is\n",

    "#### Uncertainty Visualisation\n",
    "The model uncertainty can be directly integrated as an additional UI layer only available to the clinicians. This will work in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    " Once the text is generated, entropy will be calculated for the output tokens using methods similar to task C and depending on it's value the tokens will be colored  <span style=\"background: red;\">red </span>  <span style=\"background: yellow;\">yellow </span>  <span style=\"background: green;\">green </span> respectively. This overlay can further be optimized such that instead of showing a seperate color for each token, which will lead to a lot of visual clutter, we can calculate the frequency of high entropy tokens per paragraph/sentence, and color the <span style=\"background: red;\">entire paragraph/sentence </span> to show that these sections need more consideration. This way the user can interact with the chat interface similar to any other chat based llms, and the clinicians can quicky glance the underlying uncertainty present in the generated text."

    "##### Step 1 : Embedding lookup table\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: the q_proj_out has dimension of 4 x 2048, inorder to create 32 heads from this matrix, we reshape the matrix into the shize 32 x 4 x 64. Now we have 32 heads 4 tokens and 64 dimensional embedding. For K and V the matrix size is 8 x 4 x 64.\n",

    "The outputs are multiplied by the gate 2048 x 8192 and up 2048 x 8192 dimensional matrics parallely.
